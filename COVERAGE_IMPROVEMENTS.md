# Test Coverage Improvements

This document summarizes the test coverage improvements made to the bizzaroclaude codebase.

## Summary

Added comprehensive tests to improve coverage across multiple packages, with a focus on critical business logic and error handling paths.

## Coverage Improvements by Package

### ✅ internal/format: 78.4% → 100.0% (+21.6%)

**Added tests:**
- `TestHeader` - Tests header formatting
- `TestDimmed` - Tests dimmed text output
- `TestColoredTablePrint` - Tests colored table printing
- `TestColoredTableTotalWidthCalculation` - Tests width calculations
- `TestColoredTableEmptyPrint` - Tests empty table edge case

**Impact:** Achieved **100% coverage** for the format package.

### ✅ internal/prompts/commands: 76.2% → 85.7% (+9.5%)

**Added tests:**
- `TestGenerateCommandsDirErrorHandling` - Tests error paths for directory generation
- `TestSetupAgentCommandsErrorHandling` - Tests error paths for command setup
- `TestGetCommandAllCommands` - Tests retrieval of all available commands

**Impact:** Significantly improved coverage of error handling paths.

### ✅ internal/daemon: 59.2% → 59.7% (+0.5%)

**Added tests:**
- `TestDaemonWait` - Tests daemon wait functionality
- `TestDaemonTriggerHealthCheck` - Tests health check triggering
- `TestDaemonTriggerMessageRouting` - Tests message routing triggers
- `TestDaemonTriggerWake` - Tests wake triggers
- `TestDaemonTriggerWorktreeRefresh` - Tests worktree refresh triggers

**Impact:** Improved coverage of daemon trigger functions and lifecycle management.

### ✅ internal/cli: 29.1% → 30.1% (+1.0%)

**Added tests:**
- `TestGetClaudeBinaryReturnsValue` - Tests Claude binary detection
- `TestShowVersionNoPanic` - Tests version display without panics
- `TestVersionCommandBasic` - Tests basic version command
- `TestVersionCommandJSON` - Tests version command with JSON flag
- `TestShowHelpNoPanic` - Tests help display without panics
- `TestExecuteEmptyArgs` - Tests execution with empty arguments
- `TestExecuteUnknownCommand` - Tests execution with unknown command

**Impact:** Added tests for CLI entry points and user-facing commands. The CLI package remains at lower coverage due to its size (~3700 lines) and many integration-heavy commands that require complex setup.

## Packages Maintaining Excellent Coverage

The following packages already had excellent coverage and were maintained:
- **internal/errors**: 100.0%
- **internal/logging**: 100.0%
- **internal/names**: 100.0%
- **internal/redact**: 100.0%
- **pkg/claude/prompt**: 95.5%
- **internal/prompts**: 92.0%
- **pkg/claude**: 90.0%

## Testing Best Practices Applied

1. **Error Path Coverage**: Added tests specifically for error handling and edge cases
2. **Panic Safety**: Tests verify functions don't panic under normal conditions
3. **Idempotency**: Tests verify operations can be safely repeated
4. **Edge Cases**: Tests cover empty inputs, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions
5. **Integration Testing**: Used existing test helpers and fixtures for realistic scenarios

## Files Modified

- `internal/format/format_test.go` - Added 5 new test functions
- `internal/prompts/commands/commands_test.go` - Added 3 new test functions
- `internal/daemon/daemon_test.go` - Added 5 new test functions
- `internal/cli/cli_test.go` - Added 7 new test functions

## Running Coverage Tests

# View function-level coverage
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

### High Priority (Low Coverage, Critical Code)

1. **internal/cli** (30.1% coverage)
   - Large file (~3700 lines) with many commands
   - Focus on critical commands: init, work, cleanup
   - Many commands require complex tmux/git setup

2. **internal/daemon** (59.7% coverage)
   - Core daemon loops (health check, message routing, wake loop)
   - Agent lifecycle management
   - Error recovery and cleanup logic

3. **internal/worktree** (78.6% coverage)
   - Git operations and error paths
   - Complex worktree management scenarios
   - Branch and remote operations

### Medium Priority (Moderate Coverage)

4. **internal/socket** (81.8% coverage)
   - IPC communication error paths
   - Timeout and retry logic

5. **internal/messages** (82.2% coverage)
   - Message routing edge cases
   - Concurrent message handling

6. **internal/hooks** (86.7% coverage)
   - Hook configuration edge cases

### Testing Challenges

The following areas are challenging to test due to external dependencies:
- **tmux integration**: Requires running tmux sessions
- **git operations**: Requires git repositories and network access
- **daemon lifecycle**: Requires process management and IPC
- **Claude CLI integration**: Requires Claude CLI to be installed

These areas benefit from integration tests (in `test/` directory) rather than unit tests.

## Conclusion

These improvements bring the codebase closer to comprehensive test coverage, with emphasis on:
- Critical business logic paths
- Error handling and recovery
- User-facing command functionality
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

The format package achieving 100% coverage demonstrates the quality bar for well-tested code. Future work should focus on the CLI and daemon packages which contain the most critical business logic.
